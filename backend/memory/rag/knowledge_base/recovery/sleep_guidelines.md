# Sleep and Recovery Guidelines

## Why Sleep Matters for Fitness
- Growth hormone released during deep sleep (muscle repair)
- Glycogen restoration occurs during sleep
- Neural recovery (coordination, reaction time)
- Cortisol regulation (stress hormone)

## Minimum Sleep Requirements
- **General population**: 7-9 hours
- **Athletes/heavy training**: 8-10 hours
- **Sleep debt**: Accumulates and impairs performance

## Sleep Debt and Training
- **6 hours or less**: Reduce workout intensity by 30-50%
- **5 hours or less**: Active recovery only (walking, stretching)
- **4 hours or less**: Rest day recommended

## Pre-Sleep Optimization
- Stop caffeine 8+ hours before bed
- Finish intense workouts 3+ hours before bed
- Dim lights 1 hour before sleep (blue light suppresses melatonin)
- Room temperature: 60-67°F (15-19°C)
- Avoid large meals 2 hours before bed

## Naps and Recovery
- **Power nap**: 10-20 minutes (boosts alertness, no grogginess)
- **Recovery nap**: 90 minutes (full sleep cycle, aids muscle repair)
- **Avoid**: 30-60 minute naps (wake during deep sleep = grogginess)

## Sleep Tracking Metrics
Good sleep quality indicators:
- Fall asleep within 15-20 minutes
- Sleep through night (max 1 wake-up)
- Wake feeling refreshed
- Resting heart rate within normal range

## Impact on Workout Performance
- **8+ hours sleep**: Normal intensity workouts safe
- **6-7 hours sleep**: Reduce weight by 10-20%, focus on form
- **< 6 hours sleep**: Skip heavy compounds, do bodyweight or cardio
- **< 5 hours sleep**: Rest day or light activity only

## Recovery Protocols After Poor Sleep
1. Extend warm-up by 5 minutes
2. Reduce training volume by 30%
3. Focus on technique, not PRs
4. Prioritize 8+ hours sleep following night
5. Consider afternoon workout (body more recovered)
