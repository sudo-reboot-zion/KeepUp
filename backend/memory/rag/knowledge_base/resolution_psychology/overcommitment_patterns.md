# Overcommitment and Resolution Failure Patterns

## The Overcommitment Trap
Most failed resolutions stem from plans that are too ambitious relative to current lifestyle.

## Common Overcommitment Patterns

### Pattern 1: "All or Nothing"
- **Example**: "I'll work out every single day!"
- **Why it fails**: No buffer for life chaos (illness, work deadline, travel)
- **Outcome**: Miss 2 days → feel like failure → quit entirely
- **Fix**: Start with 3x/week with optional 4th day

### Pattern 2: "Ignoring Past Failures"
- **Example**: Person who quit gym 5x/week in past tries 6x/week
- **Why it fails**: Same pattern, higher difficulty
- **Outcome**: Quit even faster (Week 2-3 instead of Week 4)
- **Fix**: Start BELOW previous attempt (if 5x failed, try 3x)

### Pattern 3: "Motivation Over Systems"
- **Example**: Relying on January enthusiasm to sustain February effort
- **Why it fails**: Motivation fades, discipline wasn't built
- **Outcome**: Quit when motivation dips (Week 4-6)
- **Fix**: Build habits first, increase intensity later

### Pattern 4: "No Contingency Plans"
- **Example**: "I'll go to gym at 6 AM" (no backup for bad sleep, early meeting)
- **Why it fails**: One obstacle derails everything
- **Outcome**: Miss workout → spiral of guilt → quit
- **Fix**: "If X happens, I'll do Y" (backup plans)

## Research-Backed Success Strategies

### Start Ridiculously Small
- **Study**: People who started with 2x/week had 73% adherence at 6 months
- **Comparison**: People who started with 5x/week had 12% adherence at 6 months
- **Takeaway**: Sustainable > ambitious

### Implementation Intentions
- **Format**: "If [situation], then I will [behavior]"
- **Example**: "If I sleep poorly, then I will do a 10-minute walk instead of HIIT"
- **Research**: Increases success rate by 2-3x

### Identity-Based Goals
- **Wrong**: "I want to lose 20 pounds"
- **Right**: "I'm becoming someone who exercises regularly"
- **Why it works**: Protects against perfectionism

## Red Flags of Overcommitment
- ⚠️ Plan requires 5+ days/week from the start
- ⚠️ No rest days built in
- ⚠️ Previous attempts failed at similar or lower intensity
- ⚠️ Life constraints (kids, job) not accounted for
- ⚠️ No backup plans for obstacles

## Adjustment Recommendations
If user shows overcommitment pattern:
1. Reduce frequency by 40-50%
2. Shorten duration (20 min better than 60 min)
3. Add explicit rest days
4. Build in "life happens" flexibility
5. Focus on streak preservation over perfection
