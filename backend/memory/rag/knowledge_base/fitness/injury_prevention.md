# Injury Prevention Guidelines

## General Principles
- Progressive overload: Increase load by no more than 10% per week:wq

- Always warm up for 5-10 minutes before training
- Prioritize form over weight
- Listen to pain signals: Sharp pain = stop immediately

## Common Injury Risk Factors
1. **Overtraining**: Training same muscle groups without 48-hour recovery
2. **Poor form**: Especially on compound lifts (squat, deadlift, bench press)
3. **Inadequate warm-up**: Cold muscles are more prone to strains
4. **Ignoring pain**: Training through sharp pain leads to chronic injuries

## Knee Injury Prevention
- Avoid daily high-impact activities (running, jumping)
- Strengthen quadriceps and hamstrings equally
- Ensure proper squat depth (thighs parallel to ground)
- Use proper footwear with cushioning
- If history of knee pain: Avoid lunges, box jumps until cleared

## Shoulder Injury Prevention
- Limit overhead pressing if shoulder pain present
- Strengthen rotator cuff muscles (band work 2x/week)
- Avoid behind-neck movements
- Keep elbows at 45-degree angle during pressing (not flared)

## Lower Back Protection
- Brace core before heavy lifts
- Never round back during deadlifts
- Limit spinal flexion under load
- If back pain history: Avoid early morning heavy lifting (discs hydrated overnight)

## Red Flags to Stop Immediately
- Sharp, stabbing pain
- Joint popping with pain
- Numbness or tingling
- Loss of range of motion
- Swelling that persists 24+ hours

## Recovery Guidelines
- 48 hours between training same muscle group
- Sleep 7-9 hours for tissue repair
- Active recovery (walking, light yoga) on rest days
- Ice acute injuries for 15 minutes every 2 hours (first 48 hours)
