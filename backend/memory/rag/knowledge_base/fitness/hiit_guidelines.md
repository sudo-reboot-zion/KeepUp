# HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) Guidelines

## What is HIIT?
HIIT alternates between short bursts of intense exercise and recovery periods.
Typically 80-95% max heart rate during work intervals.

## Benefits
- Time-efficient (20-30 minutes)
- Improves VO2 max
- Burns calories post-workout (EPOC effect)
- Preserves muscle mass better than steady cardio

## Beginner Guidelines
- **Frequency**: 2x per week maximum
- **Work:Rest ratio**: 1:3 (e.g., 20 seconds work, 60 seconds rest)
- **Duration**: 15-20 minutes total
- **Intensity**: 70-80% max heart rate
- **Example**: 30-second jog, 90-second walk, repeat 8 times

## Intermediate Guidelines
- **Frequency**: 2-3x per week
- **Work:Rest ratio**: 1:2 (e.g., 30 seconds work, 60 seconds rest)
- **Duration**: 20-30 minutes
- **Intensity**: 80-90% max heart rate

## Advanced Guidelines
- **Frequency**: 3-4x per week (non-consecutive days)
- **Work:Rest ratio**: 1:1 or 2:1
- **Duration**: 20-30 minutes
- **Intensity**: 85-95% max heart rate

## Safety Warnings
- ⚠️ **Do NOT do HIIT if**:
  - Recovering from injury
  - Sleep less than 6 hours previous night
  - Already did heavy strength training same day
  - Have uncontrolled high blood pressure
  
- **Maximum frequency**: 4x per week (overtraining risk)
- **Minimum rest**: 48 hours between sessions for same muscle groups
- **Always warm up**: 5-10 minutes before HIIT

## Signs of Overtraining
- Elevated resting heart rate
- Poor sleep quality
- Persistent muscle soreness (72+ hours)
- Decreased performance
- Irritability, low motivation

## HIIT Exercise Options
Low-impact: Cycling, rowing, swimming
Moderate-impact: Battle ropes, kettlebell swings
High-impact: Sprinting, burpees, box jumps (avoid if knee issues)
